This WP will develop a description of an open, neutral, distributed, and secure data exchange system based on MII infrastructure. It will specify open protocols and data formats for the semantically interoperable peer-to-peer exchange of multimodal healthcare data for remote AI inference.

Objectives

**[1]** Open access publication of a whitepaper on an open, fair, distributed, and secure data exchange for remote medical AI services.

**[2]** Publication of an iteratively created OMI FHIR Implementation Guide on a suitable platform (e.g. Simplifier.net).
