For the connection of the OMI protocol (see WP1) to an inference server that can be controlled via the predict protocol, the reference implementation of a gateway server will be created in this work package.

Objectives

**[1]** Compliance to the OMI protocol specified in WP1.

**[2]** Building a bridge between the medical domain and AI model computations.

**[3]** Verification of schema conformance for the input and output data of a service.

**[4]** Framework implementation for multi-modal data lookup and transcoding.

**[5]** Synchronization and routing module for connecting RACOON to OMI.

**[6]** Reference gateway server examples for common use-cases.
