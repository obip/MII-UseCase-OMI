For this work, we will identify international frameworks and principles that have already been published, and then pursue workshops with stakeholders from different areas and backgrounds. This will lead to a first framework version, which shall then be evaluated based on predefined AI application scenarios and lead to a final framework template, which can be adopted by every healthcare institution and suited to their individual requirements.
The results of this WP will also influence the work in WP6 (service registry definition), since many of our results will lead to AI service metadata characterizations, which need to be implemented within the service registry.

Objectives

 **[1]** The objective of this work package is to develop and evaluate a framework of governance and ethics principles as a template for implementations in healthcare institutions.
