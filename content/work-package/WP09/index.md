The administrative project management will be pursued by UME with a staff for administrative project management (e.g. annual reports, organization of meetings, kick-off symposium, stakeholder workshops, reimbursement of expense allowances, dissemination and communication with patient self-help-organizations). A medical informatics project manager from UME will guide the project teams from all partners during the complete project duration. They will monitor the technical, functional and scientific project progress, the interdependencies between the work packages, and the achievement of the defined milestones. The medical informatics project manager will also pursue regular risk assessments if milestones can not be achieved in due time, and will be responsible for respective mitigation measures to reiterate and then align the complete project plan again. Finally, we will establish a project collaboration platform and the project website.

Objectives

**[1]** Pursue the administrative and organizational project management, including all reporting activities for the funding agency.

**[2]** Coordinate and align all work packages and their interdependencies, as well as pursue risk management in critical project situations.

**[4]** Coordination of all networking activities, including the integration of associated partners into the project.

**[5]** Organize dissemination activities (flyers, brochures, workshops).
