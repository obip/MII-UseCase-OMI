This WP will develop a reference implementation of the client used to integrate the OMI platform into the local MII-compliant infrastructure of participating partner sites.

Objectives

 **[1]** Extend DIC persistence and transfer services to support DICOM data and OMI client integration.

**[2]** Allow manual quality assurance, adaptation, supplementation of FHIR based input and image metadata

**[3]** Enable control and execution of DICOM and FHIR data transfer from local DIC to inference services.

**[4]** Display inference execution status and store output data in the local DIC persistence services (DICOM and FHIR) where relevant.
