We're thrilled to announce that our project has been granted a second funding phase! 
This means that our important work will continue to make strides forward. 
With this new funding, our project is now set to run until the end of June 2027.

We're grateful for the ongoing support that has made this possible, and we're eager to keep pushing boundaries and achieving our goals.
