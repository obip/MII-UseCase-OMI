The DICOM-RST that implements a DICOMweb-compatible HTTP server with support for QIDO-RS, WADO-RS and STOW-RS is now open-access and the repository is downloadable at the UMEssen GitHub page.

We're gathering information about potential compatibility issues with various PACS vendors, so feel free to experiment and report issues.

Currently, the DIMSE backend is implemented, which translates DICOMweb requests into DIMSE-C operations.
